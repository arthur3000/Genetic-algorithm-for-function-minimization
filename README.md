# Genetic-algorithm-for-mathematical-minimization
Genetic algorithm focused on minimizing two-dimensional functions.

Algorithm that consists on minimizing a two-dimensional function using methods based on natural selection.  The program repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions using three types of rules: selection, crossover and mutation. This specific program minimizes 
> (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2 <br/>

But can also be applied to any similar functions. You can edit it on Individual.cpp

Running the code is very simple, all you need is: <br/>
* A C++ compiler
